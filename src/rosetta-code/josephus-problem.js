// Josephus problem is a math puzzle with a grim description:
// n prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered from 0 to nâˆ’1.
// An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner 0,
// removing every k-th prisoner and killing him. As the process goes on,
// the circle becomes smaller and smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is then freed.
// Given any n, k > 0, find out which prisoner will be the final survivor.
